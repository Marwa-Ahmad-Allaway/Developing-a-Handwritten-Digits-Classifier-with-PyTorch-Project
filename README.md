# Developing-a-Handwritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch-Project
This project is part of the AWS AI & Machine Learning Scholarship Program, within the AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity.
It serves as a practical application of the second course in the Nanodegree, titled "Introduction to Deep Learning".
In this project, PyTorch is used to build and train a neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, reinforcing key concepts such as model architecture, training loops, loss functions, and evaluation metrics.
